# 2_Channel_Spatial_Analyses
 Spatial Analysis for 2-Channel STED images 

#General Description
This repository contains example data and jupyter notebooks for conducting spatial analyses on location data for two channel populations. In this case, these channels are TREK1 and Piezo1. The csv files provided in 'data/1_Image Data'  contain necessary files for running the notebook 'NearestNeighbor_empirical_2023', which will quantify the puncta density and NNDs for both populations. The outputs of this notebook, as well as the A_mask.csv, are fed into the notebook 'NearestNeighbor_Simulations_2023'. Example outputs for each notebook can be found in there respective files in 'data/...'. The FWHM for assessing the resolution of images was quantified using the notebook 'FWHM_Resolution_2023', and data for the sampled puncta in the example image A_composite are provided in 'data/4_FWHM_lineplots'.
